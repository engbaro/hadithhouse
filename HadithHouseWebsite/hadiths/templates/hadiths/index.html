        HadithHouse is a project containing collections of Islamic Hadiths with
        an interactive GUI which allows users to search the collection,
        find the sources of hadiths and their authenticity, etc.
        The project is still in its early development stages. You can follow its progress on
        <a href="https://github.com/rafidka/hadithhouse">GitHub.</a>
